# What-to-expect-here
A notebook for project ideas+pseudocode+thoughts.
This is my personal repository to keep track of what I've done and plan to do in my github. Some of the stuff will be in python, some in C# and some will be web apps in development, depending on what I'm working on.
If any of the project ideas or pseudocode you see posted in this repo inspire you to collaborate, share your own ideas
  or give me feedback, feel free to send me a DM in slack: @kristenO.                
Peace+Love+Open Source tech to all!
