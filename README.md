A notebook for project ideas+pseudocode+thoughts.
Hello there!
This is my personal repository to keep track of what I've done and plan to do in my github.
If any of the project ideas or pseudocode you see posted in this repo inspire you to collaborate, share your own ideas
  or give me feedback, feel free to send me a DM in slack: @kristenO.                
Peace+Love+Open Source tech to all!
