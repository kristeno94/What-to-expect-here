Hello there, this is Kristen.
I am originally a mathematics student but became more interested in programming than in math as I advanced throughout my undergraduate degree.
Some cool stuff I have done in math: differential equations projects regarding population size calculation and numerical methods (specifically RK4), statistical genetics analysis for microbiome populations, and a compilation of approaches to study irrational numbers!
Recent movies I've liked a lot: Annihilation, Call me by your name.
Stuff I'm currently doing: codeacademy's 8 week JS + ReactJS intensive, a university Visual c# course, a university software engineering course.
Stuff I'm looking forward to: kaggle's 5 day data cleaning challenge in March (26-30), MUDAC and Minneapolis Data Derby in April, a software internship with Sundog Interactive in May, and teaching in uCodeGirl's Code Camps (summer 2018)!
